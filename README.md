# scientific_writing_samples
Writing I've completed over the course of my undergraduate career, mostly reports from experiments I've completed. 

Includes: 

1. NLP subfield survey: state of the art computer-generated text detection (2023) 
2. Brownian motion in cells: lab report describing experiment tracking brownian motion in plant cells
3. Optical pumping: experimentally observing and documenting the structure of Rubidium isotopes, including Zeeman and hyperfine splitting
4. Quantum interference and entanglement: performing an experiment to create entangled pairs of photons that show a violation of Bell's inequality, proving that quantum mechanics is incompatible with a local, realistic hidden variable theory (i.e. quantum mechanics describes reality more accurately than popular hidden variable theories) 
5. Topological quantum computing: exploring basic mathematical foundations behind topological quantum computing, as well as popular candidates for its implementation
6. Integrated chip calculator: designing and building a 4-bit adder circuit using integrated chips
